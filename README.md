# **🚀 ToDooly**

> ⚠️ In accordance with my agreement with **ToDooly**, I no longer retain access to the code repository.  
> 🛑 The company has since shut down, but I was able to recover several screenshots and archived links, shared below.

ToDooly was a **SaaS marketplace** connecting **college-aged young adults** with **local homeowners** needing extra help around the house.  
We raised **~$3 million** across multiple funding rounds, and I was responsible for **building the technology from the ground up**.

During my time there, I:

- **Developed the service-side facing web app that would be rewritten in React Native**
- **Built & later refactored our internal customer support/management & reporting dashboard**
- **Optimized backend performance** to improve query speed and support **real-time operations**
- Built **internal tools** for data visualization & workflow automation to help **stakeholders make better decisions**
- **Created two cross-platform mobile apps** using **React Native** for iOS and Android — one for clients booking services, and one for the laborers (our "Doers") fulfilling the work

---

## 🛠️ **Responsibilities**
- **Led the frontend rewrite** from Ionic to React Native — improved UX, maintainability, and app performance  
- **Refactored the backend server**, supporting multiple time zones and scaling to **17,000+ users** while **tripling revenue in 2022**  
- **Collaborated with designers and devs** to build stakeholder reporting & customer support tools  
- Integrated APIs like **Mixpanel, Stripe, Twilio, Mailchimp, Zapier, Typeform**, and **SendGrid**

## ⚙️ **Tools / Technologies**
**React Native, Expo Go, React, Angular.js, Ionic, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, Firebase, AWS, Heroku, Docker, Postman, Bootstrap, Webpack, Handlebar.js, Mixpanel, Stripe, Twilio, Mailchimp, Zapier, Typeform, SendGrid, Jira, Asana, Slack, Zoom**

## 🗂️ Project Archive & Availability

Since the company has shut down, the **website is no longer live**.  
However, you can still view an archived version here:  
🔗 **[ToDooly Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20220628131625/https://www.todooly.com/)**

Our **client-side React Native app** is still accessible through the following link:  
🔗 **[ToDooly App (Client Side)](https://app.todooly.com/home)**  
*Note: The mobile experience remains the same, though availability may be limited.*

> ❌ Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the **Doer-side mobile app** and was unable to recover screenshots from that version.
