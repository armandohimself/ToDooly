# **ToDooly**

ToDooly was a **SaaS marketplace** connecting **college-aged young adults** with **local homeowners and clients** in need of extra help around the home. 
We raised **~$3 million** across multiple funding rounds, and I was responsible for **building the technology from the ground up**. 
During my time there, I **developed the customer-facing website, built and rebuilt our customer support/internal management dashboard, and created two mobile apps for Android and iOS using React Native**.

## **Description**
- **Developed a cross-platform mobile app** for a **double-sided marketplace**, improving the overall experience for **workers and customers**.
- **Optimized backend performance**, improving query efficiency, reducing response times, and supporting **real-time operations**.
- **Built internal tools** for **data visualization and workflow automation**, enhancing **stakeholder decision-making**.

## **Responsibilities**
- **Led the frontend rewrite** from **Ionic to React Native**, standardizing the codebase to improve **maintainability, performance, and user experience** across **iOS and Android**.
- **Refactored the backend server** to reduce **technical debt**, enabling the mobile app to **support multiple time zones**, **scale to 17,000+ unique users**, and **triple revenue in 2022**.
- **Partnered with designers and the development team** to build **internal reporting and management tools** for stakeholders and customer support.
- **Integrated third-party APIs** like **Mixpanel, Stripe, Twilio, Mailchimp, Zapier, Typeform, and SendGrid** to enhance business functionality.

## **Tools / Technologies**
**React Native, Expo Go, React, Angular.js, Ionic, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Webpack, Node.js, Express.js, Handlebar.js, MySQL, Firebase, AWS, Heroku, Docker, Postman, Mixpanel, Stripe, Twilio, Mailchimp, Zapier, Typeform, SendGrid, Jira, Asana, Slack, Zoom**
